# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repo contains various data structure algorithms implemented with python.

## Rquirements: 
1. Python 3.6

## Data Structures and Algorithms Description: 
1. **Stack** - Element is added and removed from top. It follows LIFO.
2. **Queue** - Element is added from rear and removed from front. It follows FIFO.
3. **LinkList** - Each Node contains data and address of next node.
4. **BST** - Binary Search tree, each node has either 0, 1 or 2 childs and left child is always less than its parent and right child will be greater.
5. **Graph** - It contains various vertices connected using edges. Graph.py also contains **BFS** and **DFS** traversal.
6. **Dynamic Programming** - It is an Optimization technique which stores intermediate results which can be used further. It is explained using Fibonacci series.

### Note: 
1. Every Program is written to show the basic working of the algorithms there are not any validations on data etc.
2. Some DS and Algos like Stack and Queue doesn't have variables like top, rear and front. They can also be used for better Understanding.
3. So feel free to try and improve the code.
